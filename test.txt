By implementing the proposed solutions, we aim to:

Improve search performance using Lucene and Redis.

Reduce turnaround time through refactoring & design pattern adoption.

Enhance bidirectional data retrieval in Graph Database.

Provide better UI integration with a Metadata Service.

Consolidate APIs to avoid duplication and ensure scalability.

Optimize slow queries using preloading & caching strategies.
